# HTML-CSS Resumé Mockup for Web Design Elective Class

Welcome to the repository for the **Resumé Mockup**! This project showcases my strong HTML and CSS skills, as well as my attention to detail and perfection in designing beautiful, functional, and seamless UIs. 

To run, just open the HTML file on your favorite browser (as long as you make a folder for all the materials here) and watch the magic happen!
